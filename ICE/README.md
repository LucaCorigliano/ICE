# ICE
Disassembly of Image Composite Editor - An advanced panoramic image stitcher

### Legality
First of all. This is a Reverse Engineering effort on [Microsoft's Image Composite Editor](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/product/computational-photography-applications/image-composite-editor/). Their EULA forbids this, but since they **discontinued** the project without releasing the source code, I've decided to do it anyway, in order to preserve the usefulness of this software.
If Microsoft wishes to claim its rights, i'll take down this repository no question asked.

### What's this?
Image Composite Editor (ICE), an advanced panoramic image stitcher, was created by the Microsoft Research Computational Photography Group. Given a set of overlapping photographs of a scene shot from a single camera location, the app creates high-resolution panoramas that seamlessly combine original images. ICE was also able to create panoramas from a panning video, including stop-motion action overlaid on the background. Finished panoramas could be saved in a wide variety of image formats, including JPEG, TIFF, and Photoshopâ€™s PSD/PSB format, as well as the multiresolution tiled format used by HD View and Deep Zoom.

This disassembly effort aims to remove discontinued functionality and improve the software for automation.
